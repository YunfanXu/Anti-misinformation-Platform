# Anti-misinformation-Platform
Anti-misinformation Platform combined with browser extension application, web application, and back-end. For the back-end,  I used built-in machine learning model to classify the text string information and used Xception model with fine-tune to analysis the images and videos data. 

## Misinformation_Flask_API
[Project link](https://github.com/YunfanXu/Misinformation_Flask_API)

This is the back-end of the system, it contains pretrained Xception model to classify the manipulated facial iamges and videos, which includes Deepfakes, Face2Face, and FaceSwap. For more details for the model, please check my previous porject [here](https://github.com/YunfanXu/Detection-of-Manipulated-Facial-Video).

## misinformation_UI

This is the front-end project for the Chrome brwoser extension. You can add it into your chrome and then start the **Misinformation_Flask_API** back-end first.

## Reporters_platform
